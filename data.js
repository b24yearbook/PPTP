var raw_results = 
`{91-100} result1: You are a very model student. You probably got/get an uno in VALEd and are a teacher's pet; taga-lista ng noisy sa classroom and naglilinis kahit hindi cleaner of the day. You're probably one of the people who turned on their mics during online classes and reminded the teacher that there's homework due.
{81-90} result2: You're a good student, but wouldn't think twice about skipping the flag ceremony altogether just so you can avoid getting an NCR. Sinisita ng mga teachers and upper years (if lower year ka) kasi tumatakbo ka sa hallways or maingay ka. You probably don't have a lot of NCRs; if you do, it's probably because you're messy in the dorm, are violating the dress code, or always arrive late.
{71-80} result3: You're a troublemaker, but for some reason, no one really catches you. You probably are the type of person who submits requirements 6 hours late with the excuse of slow wifi or health problems. You also probably excuse yourself to go to the bathroom or clinic but in reality are just cutting classes. You probably have also copied someone else's code for CS and wears different-colored socks just because you can get away with it.
{61-70} result4: A walking red flag, you are hanging by a thread. You're the type that wears a zipped-up jacket to hide the fact that you're not wearing your ID - or that you're wearing an entirely different uniform underneath. You probably have used ChatGPT for your essays and have had a similarity index of above 20% in res. You probably have also never fully read the English/Fil readings and only used online summaries.
{0-60} result5: It's amazing how you haven't been kicked out yet. It's either you're really good at not getting caught, or you simply don't have enough Level 2's to warrant expulsion (JK). You probably collect NCRs like they're collectible trading cards and claim items from the DO that aren't yours. You probably DGAF about the rules and break them just to spite the admin. Linandi mo na siguro crush ng kaibigan mo tapos naging kayo tapos nagbreak rin LOL!`;
